# ANN

An artificial neural network built by Scott Gauthreaux and myself for identifying road signs.

The converter ruby script utilizes imagemagick software to edit and resize images for a standard size.

The grayscale.rb utilizes imagemagick software to edit images and make them grayscale.

Extract.py utilizes the python PIL library to convert any number of images in specified directories to binary representations of the depicted pixels, each pixel represented by an integer value 0-254 (for darkness) and writes them all into all.bin to be parsed by the ANN

The ann itself is in the ann directory
